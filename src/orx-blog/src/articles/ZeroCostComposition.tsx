                The goal of the approach discussed in this article is to enable zero-cost composition of heterogeneous types sharing a common behavior.

            <p>
                Sounds confusing ÔΩ¢(ÔæüÔæçÔæü)
            </p>

            <p>
                To demonstrate, let's consider the classical example on polymorphism.
            </p>

            <div className="emphasis">
                We want to implement a screen that can draw all elements of a heterogeneous collection of components that can be drawn.
            </div>

            <p>
                Two well-known solutions are the trait object & enum solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                This article proposes a third approach, which is considerably different :)
            </p>

            <p>
                Before diving in, a brief note on the generic associated types (GATs) which is a relatively recent feature of rust type system.
            </p>

            <p>
                GATs are often associated with lifetimes.
                This is natural as it solves important lifetime-related issues.
                Even when the initiative was introduced, the examples focused on solving lifetime issues,
                as in this <Link text="amazing article" href="https://rust-lang.github.io/generic-associated-types-initiative/explainer/iterable.html" />.
                However, its power goes way beyond.&nbsp;
                <span className="inline-emphasis">GATs are functions of the type system</span> and functions are powerful.
                The approach described in this article is based on this.
            </p>

            <p>
                Discussed solution is published in the <code>queue</code> module of the <Link text="orx-meta" href="https://crates.io/crates/orx-meta" /> crate.
            </p>

            <h2>Another Way to Draw Components on the Screen</h2>

            <p>
                The classical problem about polymorphism, which is also used in rust book's&nbsp;
                <Link text="trait objects chapter" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-02-trait-objects.html" />, is as follows:
            </p>

            <div className="seq">
                <div>We have a <code>Draw</code> trait and various components, such as button and select box, implement this trait.</div>
                <div>The <code>Screen</code> is a collection of components that we can draw.</div>
                <div>Three methods are required for the screen.</div>
                <div>
                    Screen is sort of a collection, so we need <code>new</code> to
                    create an empty screen and <code>push</code> to add components.
                </div>
                <div>The third method <code>draw</code> is related to the common behavior and draws all components on the screen.</div>
            </div>

            <p>We first set up the draw trait and a couple of implementations for demonstration.</p>

            <Code code={drawTrait} />




            <h2>Approach #1: Trait Objects</h2>

            <p>
                Using trait objects can be considered as the standard way to solve this problem.
                It is pretty much identical to solutions in object-oriented languages such as Java or C#.
            </p>

            <Code code={solutionTraitObjects} />

            <div style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr', }}>
                <div>
                    <p style={{ color: 'lime', fontWeight: 'bold', textAlign: 'center' }}>PROS</p>
                    <div className="seq">
                        <div>
                            It is open for extension. Another codebase can define a new component, implement <code>Draw</code> for it and add it to the screen.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            No boilerplate code is required.
                            We only iterate over elements of the vec and call draw on each item.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <code>Screen</code> is nothing but a wrapper for <code>Vec</code>.
                            No additional types are required.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold', textAlign: 'center' }}>CONS</p>
                    <div className="seq">
                        <div>Requires heap allocation for each component since they need to be <code>Box</code>ed.</div>
                        <div><code>draw</code> calls of components are virtual; hence, requires dynamic dispatch.</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                When the cons are not critical, we usually prefer this approach.
                It is simple, convenient and dynamic.
            </p>

            <p>For other cases, we consider the second approach.</p>

            <h2>Approach #2: Enums</h2>

            <p>
                Another elegant way to represent polymorphic behavior in rust is to use sum types or enums.
                Enum solution for this example could look like the following.
            </p>

            <Code code={solutionEnums} />

            <div style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr', }}>
                <div>
                    <p style={{ color: 'lime', fontWeight: 'bold', textAlign: 'center' }}>PROS</p>
                    <div className="seq">
                        <div>
                            No heap allocation required.
                            We might waste some memory when sizes of different components vary significantly.
                            Nevertheless, this is preferable over boxing in most cases.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            No virtual method calls.&nbsp;
                            <code>component.draw()</code> is a direct call.
                            It might have runtime branching cost due to potentially large <code>match</code> clause.
                            This is still preferable over dynamic dispatch in most cases.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <code>Screen</code> is nothing but a wrapper for <code>Vec</code>.
                            No additional types are required.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold', textAlign: 'center' }}>CONS</p>
                    <div className="seq">
                        <div>
                            It is closed for extension.
                            Defining a new component and implementing <code>Draw</code> for it is not sufficient.
                            The variant must also be added to the <code>Component</code> enum.
                            And adding the variant is a breaking change ‚ÄºÔ∏è
                            Therefore, this approach is most suitable when only we extend and we don't extend often.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            Some boilerplate involved in <code>Component::draw</code> implementation.
                            The <code>match</code> statement gets larger and larger as we define more variants.
                            Thankfully, crates such as <Link text="enum_dispatch" href="https://crates.io/crates/enum_dispatch" /> let us overcome this issue üöÄ
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Notice that we end up with significantly different properties.</p>

            <p>
                One thing in common though: we use a <code>Vec</code> to store the components.
                This will change in the third approach.
            </p>




            <h2>Approach #3: Statically-Typed Queue and Zero Cost Composition</h2>

            <p>As mentioned before, this will be a completely different approach.</p>

            <div className="seq">
                <div>
                    We will first see the solution in the following code block.
                    Due to use of the <Link text="define_queue" href="https://docs.rs/orx-meta/latest/orx_meta/macro.define_queue.html" /> macro,
                    it will not be clear at first.
                </div>
                <div>Then, we will see the expansion, dive into details and discuss how GATs make it possible.</div>
                <div>Finally, we will discuss what we cannot represent and why we need the macro.</div>
            </div>

            <p>For now, knowing the following will be helpful:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>StScreen</code> is a trait representing a statically-typed queue of heterogeneous components „Äå(¬∞„Éò¬∞)</li>
                <li><code>EmptyScreen</code> and non-empty <code>Screen</code> structs are the two <code>StScreen</code> implementations.</li>
                <li>The screen, or queue of components, can only have elements that implement <code>Draw</code>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Note that queue is the general term, while screen is used for this example; they are often used interchangeable in this article.</p>

            <p>
                Lastly, in addition to individual components,&nbsp;
                <span className="inline-emphasis">we require both empty and non-empty screen to implement Draw</span>.
                This is the key idea behind zero-cost compositions.
            </p>

            <Code code={solutionComposition} />

            <div style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr', }}>
                <div>
                    <p style={{ color: 'lime', fontWeight: 'bold', textAlign: 'center', }}>PROS</p>
                    <div className="seq">
                        <div>
                            It is open for extension. Another codebase can define a new component, implement <code>Draw</code> for it and add it to the screen.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            No heap allocation required for the components.
                            There is not even an allocation for a <code>Vec</code>.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            No virtual method calls, all <code>draw</code> calls are statically dispatched.
                            Further, there is no run-time branching.&nbsp;
                            <code>screen.draw()</code> call can completely be inlined by the compiler
                            as <code>btn1.draw(); btn2.draw(); sbox.draw(); btn3.draw();</code>.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            No boilerplate code is required.
                            We only define the <span className="inline-emphasis">identity</span> and <span className="inline-emphasis">composition</span>&nbsp;
                            definitions of the shared behavior <code>Draw</code>.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold', textAlign: 'center', }}>CONS</p>
                    <div className="seq">
                        <div>
                            <code>Screen</code> with generic parameters is a more complicated type than the <code>Vec</code> wrappers used in the previous approaches.
                            On the other hand, we can conveniently work with it without needing its concrete type since it can be used as <code>impl Draw</code>.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            More importantly, it is statically-typed.
                            This means that concrete types of all of its elements must be known at the compile time.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>


            <p>
                The queue has nice properties due to being statically-typed,
                but on the other hand, this brings serious limitations on where it can be used.
                We will discuss potential use cases later.
            </p>

            <p>Let's first clarify the pros.</p>
            <p>
                Consider the following implementation which is hand-written specifically for a screen with three buttons
                and one select-box.
                It is easy to notice that this solution attains the above-mentioned pros.
            </p>

            <Code code={solutionCompositionHandWritten} />

            <p>Under the hood, this is identical to the screen implementation as a statically-typed queue.</p>

            <p>We will see <i>how</i> in the next section.</p>




            <h2>Expansion and the Power of GATs</h2>

            <p>You might have figured out that every time we push a component to the screen, we obtain a new queue type.</p>

            <p>Every concrete queue type is statically-typed in its components.</p>

            <p>This works all thanks to the rust-type system and the power of GATs üí™</p>

            <p>To understand the queue types better, let's check the expanded version of the solution provided above.</p>

            <Code code={solutionCompositionExpansion} />

            <div className="emphasis">
                Note the resemblance of <code>push</code> method and <code>PushBack</code> type,&nbsp;
                <span className="inline-emphasis">GATs are functions of the type system</span>.
            </div>

            <p>Let's check each of the three queue definitions in detail.</p>


            <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>i. <code>StScreen</code>: the trait for statically-typed queues</h3>

            <p>
                The <code>StScreen</code> trait defines a queue with statically-typed elements and a constant <code>LEN</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although this is not important for this problem, it is useful to clarify that this a queue.
                We <code>push</code> to the back of the queue.
                The <code>Front</code> element can be popped,
                and <code>Back</code> represents the queue containing the remaining elements when the front element is popped.
                This is a choice regarding other use cases, we could've chosen a stack or a double-ended queue as well.
            </p>

            <p>Most important detail of this trait is the following GAT:</p>

            <Code code={stScreenPushBack} />

            <p><code>PushBack&lt;T&gt;</code> is the concrete type we obtain if we push an element of type <code>T</code> to this queue.</p>

            <div className="seq">

                <div>Firstly, the condition <code>T: Draw</code> ensures that our queue may only contain <code>Draw</code> types.</div>

                <div>
                    Secondly, whatever the type we get by pushing <code>T</code> to the queue, it also has to implement <code>StScreen</code>, the trait itself.
                    This has <span className="inline-emphasis">the most useful consequence</span>.
                    It means that we can call <code>PushBack</code> on the resulting type;
                    and then we can call <code>PushBack</code> on the resulting type;
                    ... (‚ôæÔ∏è or 256?).
                    We will always get another queue.
                </div>

            </div>

            <p>Now, all we need is two concrete implementations: one for empty queue and one for non-empty.</p>



            <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>ii. Empty queue</h3>

            <p>
                This can be considered as the <code>Nil</code> of our queue.
                The only important detail here is that, when we push component <code>T</code> to it,
                we receive <code>Screen&lt;T, EmptyScreen&gt;</code>.
                This is a screen with one component which is of type <code>T</code>.
            </p>



            <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>iii. Non-empty queue</h3>

            <p>
                The <code>Screen</code> is a queue that has at least one element which is at the <code>Front</code>.
                The <code>Back</code> of it might be an <code>EmptyScreen</code> or another non-empty <code>Screen</code>.
                Therefore, this struct can represent non-empty queues with any number of elements.

            <div className="seq">
                <div>
                    It is straightforward to see that the resulting type must be a non-empty <code>Screen</code> since we are pushing an element
                    to the current queue.
                </div>
                <div>Since this is a queue, we want to keep the front <code>F</code> in the front of the new queue as well.</div>
                <div>
                    Back of the current queue <code>B</code> is also a queue; i.e., <code>StScreen</code>.
                    This allows us to call <code>B::PushBack&lt;T&gt;</code> to determine type of back of the new queue.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Combining these two, we obtain a new <code>Screen</code> where the front remains to be <code>F</code> and
                    the back is determined by <code>B::PushBack&lt;T&gt;</code>.
                </div>
            </div>

                To make it more concrete, consider the following table summarizing concrete types of queues
                up to four elements, given the types of its elements.

                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>This is all we need to represent all statically-typed queues!</p>

            <p>All these concrete types are available to us through one trait and two implementations.</p>





            <h2>Side Quest, a Generic Builder for Any Struct</h2>

            <p>Consider what we would have if we removed the <code>Draw</code> requirement from elements and queues.</p>

            <p>We would end up with a statically-typed queue of <span className="inline-emphasis">anything</span>. This is an ad-hoc struct.</p>

            <p>We already have tuples for this.</p>

            <p>
                However, incremental build capability of queues is handy.
                For instance, it allows us to create a generic&nbsp;
                <Link text="QueueBuilder" href="https://docs.rs/orx-meta/latest/orx_meta/queue/struct.QueueBuilder.html" /> that we can use for any struct.
                Since the queues are statically-typed in its elements,
                the builder prevents calling <code>push</code> with wrong types or in wrong order,
                and prevents us from <code>finish</code>ing early or late.
            </p>

            <p>

            <Code code={genericQueueBuilder} />





            <h2>The Idea of Composition</h2>

            <p>After the side quest, we bring back the <code>Draw</code> requirement.</p>

            <p>
                We do not want a queue of anything.
                We want a queue of things that share a common behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to elements of the queue,&nbsp;
                <span className="inline-emphasis"> we require the queue itself to implement the common behavior</span>.
                This is how we achieve zero-cost composition.
            </p>

            <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>Identity: Draw for empty Queue</h3>

            <p>
                Implementing the common behavior for the empty queue describes what we should do in the absence of any elements.
                This is straightforward for the screen example, we do nothing when there is nothing to draw.
            </p>


            <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>Composition: Draw for non-empty Queue</h3>

            <p>
                Implementing the common behavior for the non-empty queue describes what we should do when there are multiple
                elements.
            </p>

            <p>
                This might be a bit confusing when the front of the queue is an element but the back of the queue is another queue
                containing the remaining elements.
            </p>

            <p>
                To make it easier, let's assume the back is a queue of a single element.
                In other words, our queue has two elements.
                What should <code>draw</code> do in this case?
                It seems sensible to draw both of them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recall our implementation.
            </p>

            <Code code={screenImplDraw} />

            <p>
                When we have two elements, our queue type is <code>Screen&lt;C1, Screen&lt;C2, EmptyScreen&gt;&gt;</code>.
                Omitting the <code>self.</code> for brevity, we would have <code>f: C1</code>, <code>b: Screen&lt;C2, EmptyScreen&gt;</code>.
                We can substitute <code>b.draw()</code> with <code>b.f.draw()</code> and <code>b.b.draw()</code>.
                We stop here as <code>b.b</code> is an empty queue.
                Therefore, the draw call on a two element queue could be inlined as <code>f.draw(); b.f.draw(); b.b.draw();</code>.
                Since the last draw call on empty screen does nothing, this method would draw two of our components.
                This is the expected behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
                Notice that everything would work exactly the same if we had a queue of three elements; i.e., <code>Screen&lt;C1, Screen&lt;C2, Screen&lt;C3, EmptyScreen&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.
                We would do one more substitution to reach the empty queue and we would end up with <code>f.draw(); b.f.draw(); b.b.f.draw(); b.b.b.draw();</code>.
                This would draw three of the components, which is again the expected behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, once we define what to do with an empty queue and how to compose two elements,
                we attain the expected behavior for any number of elements in the queue.
            </p>





            <h3>Another Example, Composing Business Criteria</h3>

            <p>
                We can define different ways to compose elements sharing a common behavior depending on the use case.
                A second example might help demonstrate the power of composition.
            </p>

            <p>
                Assume that we are evaluating vehicle tours with respect to different business criteria.
                Our shared behavior is the <code>Criterion</code> trait.
                Its <code>evaluate</code> method takes the <code>tour</code> to evaluate and <code>previous_status</code> of the tour,
                and returns the new status.
            </p>

            <p>
                In real life, different operations and different regions might have different sets of criteria.
                In the example below, we have three relevant criteria: <code>Distance</code>, <code>Capacity</code> and <code>Precedence</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We again define our criteria queue with the <code>define_queue</code> macro.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, we implement <code>Criterion</code> for our empty queue, <code>EmptyCriteria</code>.
                It just returns back the <code>previous_state</code>.
                This is the identity behavior of evaluation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, we implement <code>Criterion</code> for the non-empty queue, <code>Criteria</code>.
                Here, we first evaluate the tour with respect to the first criterion in the front.
                Then, we pass on the resulting status to the back of the queue to evaluate.
                This is the composition.
            </p>


            <Code code={exampleCriteria} />




            <h2>Why do we need the macro?</h2>

            <p>It felt so close to represent this pattern without macros, but no luck ~( ¬¥‚Ä¢Ô∏µ‚Ä¢` )~</p>

            <p>
                orx-meta crate provides the <code>StQueue</code> trait together with&nbsp;
                <code>EmptyQueue</code> and <code>Queue</code> implementations.
                Naturally, these default implementations do not have the requirement on elements to be <code>Draw</code> or <code>Criterion</code>.
                Therefore, they define <span className="inline-emphasis">statically-typed queue of anything</span>.
                As explained in the builder side quest, this can still be useful.
            </p>

            <p>But the queue is most useful when it is coupled with a shared behavior of heterogeneous types.</p>

            <p>To achieve this, what we actually need is something like the following.</p>

            <Code code={wontCompile} />

            <p>
                If we substitute <code>X</code> with <code>Draw</code> we obtain the <code>StScreen</code> trait in our example,
                if we substitute with <code>Criterion</code> we get <code>StCriteria</code>.
            </p>

            <p><code>X</code> here is a trait, or I should say, it can be any trait.</p>

            <p>We need our <code>StQueue</code> trait to be generic over another trait.</p>

            <p>This won't compile today (‚å£_‚å£‚Äù)</p>

            <p>For now, I used the escape patch.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We cannot represent our solution within the type system.</li>
                <li>Abstraction seems to be as simple as a string substitution.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Luckily, this is one of the easy cases for <code>macro_rules!</code></p>

            <Code code={macro} />

            <p>
                The macro call above has two blocks.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>queue</code> block is just giving names to (i) the statically-typed queue trait, (ii) empty queue struct
                and (iii) non-empty queue struct.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>elements</code> block is the important part.
                Here, we provide a comma-separated list of traits that define the common behavior of heterogeneous elements of the queue.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, the macro defines the queue types exactly as we saw in the expansion with only one difference.
                It adds the traits listed in <code>elements</code> as requirements to elements of the queues,
                and it requires the queues to implement the traits themselves
                (in other words, it replaces <code>X</code> above with these traits).
            </p>







            <h2>Limitations and Use Cases</h2>

            <p>As mentioned in the cons, having statically-typed elements limits potential use cases of the queue.</p>

            <p>In the following, we discuss two use cases where this pattern can be utilized.</p>




            <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>A. As a Collection, <code>Draw</code> Example</h3>

            <p>
                Although it is statically-typed, we can still use the queue as a collection, as in the <code>Draw</code> example.
                But recall that we have to know types of all elements during compile time.
            </p>

            <p>This fits to situations where we instantiate the collection during the <span className="inline-emphasis">start up</span> of a service.</p>

            <p>
                We often parse configuration files into the collection.
                For instance, we can have a json file listing components to be included in the screen.
            </p>

            <p>This means that we know the types of all components, we can also use the statically-typed queue.</p>

            <p>
                In the following, we a screen initialization as a vector of trait objects parsed from a json file on the left,
                and as a statically-typed queue on the right.
            </p>

            <div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr' }}>
                <Code code={startupTraitObjects} />
                <Code code={startupQueue} />
            </div>

            <p>
                Whenever configuration changes, we must re-compile with the queue approach.
                On the other hand, initialization can never fail.
            </p>

            <p>Further, the queue brings performance and memory advantages.</p>

            <p>
                For a screen containing 200 components with toy draw implementations, statically-typed queue approach is two times faster than
                trait objects or enum-components approaches.
                You may see the corresponding benchmarks <Link text="here" href="https://github.com/orxfun/orx-meta/tree/main/benches" />.
            </p>

            <p>Further, being memory efficient and not requiring heap allocation makes it beneficial for embedded applications.</p>

            <p>
                We must, however, be careful about the queue size.
                As far as I experienced, the compiler does not seem happy for queues with more than 256 elements ‚óèÔπè‚óè
            </p>





            <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>B. Tool to deal with Custom Requirements, <code>Criteria</code> Example</h3>

            <p>This has been the main idea to develop the queues for.</p>

            <p>
                Assume that we are maintaining a performance-critical tool with with, say, <code>5</code> features.
                We want our tool to be useful for as many use cases as possible.
                Every use case requires a different subset of our features.
                There exist <code>2^5-1 = 31</code> potential use cases.
                How can we cover them all?
            </p>

            <p>
                We will not have fun if we need to manually combine the features;
                or if we lose performance due to abstraction.
            </p>

            <p>On the other hand, if we can define the composition of these features using a statically-typed queue:</p>

            <div className="seq">
                <div>We can work on and maintain each feature in isolation.</div>
                <div>
                    Implementing the <code>6</code>-th feature allows us cover <code>32</code> more potential use cases,
                    making it well-worth the effort.
                </div>
                <div>And we will have access to all combinations of these features without any manual work and without loss of performance.</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Recall the example for evaluating vehicle tours, where we implemented three criteria.
                The following demonstrates how we can use them in four different use cases.
            </p>

            <Code code={criteriaCombinations} />









            <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p>This pattern is powerful for composing zero-cost abstractions.</p>

            <p>Although, having to know types of elements in compile time limits its use cases, there are situations that we can benefit from it.</p>

            <p>Especially in performance critical programs since it allows us to avoid dynamic dispatch, heap allocation and run-time branching all together.</p>


            <p>
                I first started experimenting with GATs for composing business constraints and objectives for a performance-critical route optimization library.
                If you are interested, you may check a relevant <Link text="talk" href="https://orxfun.github.io/talk-composing-zero-cost-abstractions-in-route-optimization/" />&nbsp;
                discussing the importance of zero cost composition.
                Actually, it seems to be the only way to achieve a <span className="inline-emphasis">performant, extensible and maintainable solution at the same time</span>.
                The generalization led to the queue explained here, and seems like I will be using it more for algorithm abstractions such as the local search.
            </p>
